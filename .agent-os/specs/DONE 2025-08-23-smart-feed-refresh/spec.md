> Spec: Smart Feed Refresh System
> Created: 2025-08-23
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a priority-based sequential feed refresh system with adaptive scheduling to optimize refresh performance for users with large feed lists. The system will intelligently prioritize feeds based on user activity, posting frequency, and unread counts while maintaining compatibility with existing auto-refresh and mark-as-read functionality.

## User Stories

### High-Volume Feed User

As a power RSS user with 100+ feeds, I want the system to refresh my most important feeds first, so that I see new content from active sources quickly without waiting for all feeds to complete.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. System calculates priority scores for all feeds based on activity and user engagement
2. Refreshes feeds sequentially in priority order (highest first)
3. User sees new articles appearing incrementally from most important feeds
4. Lower priority feeds refresh in background without blocking high-priority updates
5. System learns from posting patterns to optimize future refresh cycles

### Resource-Conscious User

As a self-hosted user, I want the refresh system to be efficient with server resources, so that my system remains responsive and doesn't waste bandwidth on inactive feeds.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. System tracks historical posting patterns for each feed
2. Adjusts refresh frequency based on actual posting behavior
3. Skips or delays refreshes for consistently inactive feeds
4. Monitors system resource usage and adapts batch sizes accordingly
5. Provides visibility into refresh status and resource usage

## Spec Scope

1. **Priority-Based Feed Scoring** - Algorithm to rank feeds by importance using multiple factors
2. **Sequential Refresh Engine** - Process feeds one-by-one in priority order with configurable batching
3. **Adaptive Scheduling** - Learn posting patterns and adjust refresh frequencies dynamically
4. **Resource Management** - Monitor and control system resource usage during refresh operations
5. **Health Monitoring** - Track feed health and handle failures gracefully without blocking other feeds

## Out of Scope

- Real-time WebSocket/SSE updates (future enhancement)
- User-configurable per-feed refresh intervals (Phase 6 feature)
- Multi-process worker pools (over-engineering for current needs)
- Complete rewrite of existing refresh infrastructure

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Priority-based refresh order** - Users see most important feeds updated first in the frontend
2. **Faster perceived performance** - High-priority feeds appear within 1-2 minutes instead of waiting for full refresh cycle
3. **Reduced system load** - Inactive feeds refreshed less frequently, active feeds prioritized appropriately
