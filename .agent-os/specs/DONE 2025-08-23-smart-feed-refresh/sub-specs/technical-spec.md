# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-23-smart-feed-refresh/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-23
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- **Priority Scoring Algorithm** - Multi-factor scoring system using unread count, user activity, posting frequency, and read percentage
- **Sequential Processing Engine** - Replace bulk feed refresh with configurable sequential processing (batch size 5-10 feeds)
- **Adaptive Frequency Tracking** - Monitor posting patterns over 2-week windows and adjust refresh intervals accordingly
- **Resource Monitoring** - Track refresh duration and system load to optimize batch sizes dynamically
- **Health Monitoring** - Detect and handle failed feeds without blocking others, with exponential backoff retry logic
- **Backwards Compatibility** - Maintain existing auto-refresh service API and frontend integration points

## Approach Options

**Option A: Modify Existing Auto-Refresh Service**
- Pros: Minimal disruption to current architecture, reuses existing scheduling logic, easier testing
- Cons: May inherit limitations of current design, harder to optimize for new requirements

**Option B: New Smart Refresh Service with Legacy Fallback** (Selected)
- Pros: Clean implementation, can optimize for new requirements, easy A/B testing, maintains rollback option
- Cons: More code to maintain, need careful integration with existing systems

**Rationale:** Option B allows us to implement the new priority-based system without risking the stability of existing functionality. We can gradually migrate users to the new system and fall back if issues arise.

## External Dependencies

- **No new external libraries required** - Implementation uses existing FastAPI, Peewee, and asyncio infrastructure
- **Database schema additions** - New fields for feed priority scoring and posting pattern tracking

## Implementation Architecture

### Priority Scoring System
```python
class FeedPriorityCalculator:
    def calculate_priority(self, feed: Feed) -> float:
        # Factors: unread_count (40%), user_activity (30%), posting_frequency (20%), read_percentage (10%)
        pass
```

### Smart Refresh Engine  
```python
class SmartRefreshService:
    async def refresh_feeds_by_priority(self, batch_size: int = 10):
        # Get prioritized feed list
        # Process in batches with configurable delays
        # Update frontend incrementally
        pass
```

### Integration Points
- Replace `refreshAllFeeds()` calls with `SmartRefreshService.refresh_feeds_by_priority()`
- Maintain existing `isAutoRefresh=true` flag for frontend compatibility
- Preserve all existing scroll tracking and mark-as-read functionality
