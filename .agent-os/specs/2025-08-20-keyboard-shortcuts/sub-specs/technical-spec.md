# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-20-keyboard-shortcuts/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-20
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- Global keyboard event listener that works across all components without interfering with form inputs
- Visual focus indicators for keyboard-selected articles with proper accessibility (ARIA attributes)
- Keyboard shortcut help overlay that displays contextual shortcuts based on current view
- Integration with existing article actions (mark read/unread, star, open) without code duplication
- Proper event handling to prevent conflicts with browser shortcuts and form inputs
- Responsive behavior that works on both desktop and tablet devices (mobile excluded due to virtual keyboards)

## Approach Options

**Option A: Component-level Event Listeners**
- Pros: Scoped to individual components, easier to manage state
- Cons: Complex coordination between components, potential conflicts, harder to maintain global shortcuts

**Option B: Global Event Handler with Action Dispatch** (Selected)
- Pros: Centralized keyboard logic, consistent behavior, easier to debug and maintain
- Cons: Requires careful event delegation, more complex initial setup

**Rationale:** Option B provides better user experience consistency and is easier to maintain long-term. Global handling ensures shortcuts work regardless of focus state and allows for more sophisticated features like modal-aware shortcuts.

## External Dependencies

- **No new external libraries required** - Implementation uses native JavaScript KeyboardEvent API
- **Justification:** Keyboard handling is straightforward enough that existing browser APIs provide all necessary functionality without adding bundle size

## Implementation Architecture

### Keyboard Service (New)
- `keyboardService.js` - Central handler for all keyboard events
- Event filtering logic to avoid conflicts with form inputs
- Configurable shortcut mappings for future customization

### Focus Management System
- Article focus tracking with visual indicators
- Accessible navigation with proper ARIA attributes
- Integration with existing ArticleList component

### Help Overlay Component
- Modal component displaying current shortcuts
- Context-aware help (different shortcuts in different views)
- Search functionality for finding specific shortcuts

### Integration Points
- Hooks into existing `apiActions` from stores
- Uses existing modal system for help overlay
- Extends current article selection logic
