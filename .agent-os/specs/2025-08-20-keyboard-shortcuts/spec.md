> Spec: Keyboard Shortcuts for RSS Reader Navigation
> Created: 2025-08-20
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement comprehensive keyboard shortcuts for the Zib RSS Reader to enable power users to navigate efficiently without using a mouse, following established RSS reader conventions and improving reading workflow speed.

## User Stories

### Efficient Article Navigation

As a power RSS user, I want to use keyboard shortcuts to navigate between articles, so that I can quickly scan through my feeds without interrupting my reading flow with mouse interactions.

**Workflow**: User opens category with many articles, uses j/k keys to move up/down through article list, space/enter to open articles, and m to mark as read/unread, allowing for rapid content consumption.

### Quick Feed Management

As a daily RSS reader, I want to use keyboard shortcuts for common actions like starring articles and switching between categories, so that I can efficiently manage my reading queue and organize important content.

**Workflow**: User navigates feeds with arrow keys, uses s to star/unstar important articles, r to refresh current category, and number keys to quickly switch between frequently used categories.

### Reading Focus Mode

As a content consumer, I want keyboard shortcuts to control article display and reading modes, so that I can customize my reading experience and maintain focus on content without UI distractions.

**Workflow**: User uses ? to view help overlay, esc to close modals, and specific keys to toggle between list/card view modes for optimal reading based on content type.

## Spec Scope

1. **Article Navigation Shortcuts** - j/k for next/previous article, enter/space for opening articles
2. **Action Shortcuts** - m for mark read/unread, s for star/unstar, r for refresh  
3. **View Control Shortcuts** - v for view mode toggle, f for filter cycling, esc for modal close
4. **Category Navigation** - arrow keys for sidebar navigation, 1-9 for quick category access
5. **Help System** - ? key for keyboard shortcut help overlay with searchable commands

## Out of Scope

- Text editing shortcuts within article content
- Browser-level shortcuts (zoom, back/forward)
- Custom user-defined keyboard mappings (future phase)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Users can navigate through article lists using j/k keys with visual focus indicators
2. Common actions (read/unread, star, refresh) accessible via single keystrokes
3. Help overlay (?) displays all available shortcuts with descriptions and is searchable
