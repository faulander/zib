> Spec: Error Handling and Recovery System
> Created: 2025-08-24
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms throughout the RSS reader to ensure graceful failure handling, user-friendly error messages, and automatic recovery from common issues.

## User Stories

### Reliable RSS Reading Experience

As an RSS reader user, I want the application to handle errors gracefully and recover automatically when possible, so that temporary network issues or feed problems don't disrupt my reading experience.

Users will see helpful error messages when issues occur, have the option to retry failed operations, and experience automatic recovery from temporary problems. The system will continue working even when some feeds fail, isolate errors to prevent system-wide failures, and provide clear feedback about what went wrong and what actions are available.

## Spec Scope

1. **Feed refresh error handling** - Graceful handling of broken feeds, network timeouts, and parsing errors
2. **User-friendly error messages** - Clear, actionable error messages instead of technical stack traces
3. **Automatic retry mechanisms** - Intelligent retry logic for temporary failures with exponential backoff
4. **Partial failure handling** - Continue operation when some components fail (some feeds work, others don't)
5. **Error recovery actions** - User-initiated retry options and system self-healing capabilities

## Out of Scope

- Complex distributed system error handling
- Advanced monitoring and alerting systems
- Error reporting to external services
- Database corruption recovery mechanisms

## Expected Deliverable

1. RSS feed failures are handled gracefully without breaking the entire refresh process
2. Users receive clear error messages with actionable recovery options
3. Temporary network or server issues recover automatically without user intervention
