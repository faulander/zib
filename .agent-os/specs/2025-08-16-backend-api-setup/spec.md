# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Backend API Setup & Database Management
> Created: 2025-08-16
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Establish the core backend infrastructure for Zib RSS reader with FastAPI and SQLite database foundation. This spec creates the database schema, migration system, and CRUD operations necessary to support RSS feed management, categorization, and filtering functionality.

## User Stories

### Backend Infrastructure Setup

As a developer, I want a properly structured FastAPI backend with database connectivity, so that I can build RSS management features on a solid foundation.

The backend will provide RESTful API endpoints for feed management, use Pydantic models for data validation, and integrate with a SQLite database through Peewee ORM. This includes proper project structure, environment configuration, and database migration capabilities.

### Feed and Category Management

As a user, I want the system to store and organize my RSS feeds with categories, so that I can efficiently manage my content sources.

The database will store feed URLs, metadata, categories, and user preferences. The system will support CRUD operations for feeds and categories, with proper validation and error handling through the API layer.

### Filtering and Organization Foundation

As a user, I want the system to support filtering and organization of feeds, so that I can customize my reading experience.

The database schema will include tables for filters, preferences, and content organization that will support future features like keyword filtering, read/unread status, and personalized feed management.

## Spec Scope

1. **FastAPI Application Setup** - Create structured FastAPI application with proper routing, middleware, and configuration management
2. **Database Schema Design** - Design and implement SQLite database schema for feeds, categories, filters, and user preferences using Peewee ORM
3. **Migration System** - Implement database migration system for schema versioning and updates
4. **Feed CRUD Operations** - Create complete CRUD API endpoints for RSS feed management with validation
5. **Category Management** - Implement category creation, assignment, and management functionality
6. **Project Structure** - Establish Python best practices project structure with proper module organization
7. **Environment Configuration** - Set up configuration management for different environments (development, testing, production)

## Out of Scope

- Frontend implementation (covered in separate spec)
- RSS feed parsing and content fetching (covered in separate spec)
- User authentication and authorization (future spec)
- Advanced filtering algorithms (future spec)
- OPML import/export functionality (separate spec)

## Expected Deliverable

1. A running FastAPI application accessible at http://localhost:8000 with API documentation
2. SQLite database with properly designed schema for feeds, categories, and filters
3. Working CRUD endpoints for feed and category management that can be tested via API documentation
4. Database migration system that can create and update schema versions
5. Proper project structure following Python best practices with organized modules and packages
