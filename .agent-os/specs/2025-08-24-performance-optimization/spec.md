> Spec: Performance Optimization and Database Improvements
> Created: 2025-08-24
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement comprehensive performance optimizations including database indexing, query optimization, caching strategies, and frontend performance improvements to ensure the RSS reader remains fast and responsive as data grows.

## User Stories

### Responsive User Experience

As an RSS reader user with thousands of articles and dozens of feeds, I want the application to remain fast and responsive, so that I can efficiently browse and search content without delays.

The system will optimize database queries, implement strategic caching, and improve frontend performance to handle large datasets smoothly. Users will experience fast page loads, quick search results, and smooth scrolling even with extensive article collections. This solves performance degradation issues that occur as users accumulate large amounts of RSS content.

## Spec Scope

1. **Database indexing strategy** - Add strategic indexes for common query patterns and filtering operations
2. **Query optimization** - Optimize slow queries, implement efficient joins, and reduce N+1 query problems
3. **Caching implementation** - Cache frequently accessed data like feed lists, categories, and recent articles
4. **Frontend performance** - Optimize component rendering, implement virtual scrolling, and improve bundle size
5. **Monitoring and metrics** - Add performance monitoring to identify and track optimization opportunities

## Out of Scope

- Complete database migration to different system (PostgreSQL, etc.)
- CDN implementation for static assets
- Server-side rendering optimizations
- Advanced caching systems (Redis, Memcached)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Database queries execute efficiently even with tens of thousands of articles
2. Frontend remains responsive during data-heavy operations
3. Performance monitoring provides visibility into system bottlenecks and improvements
