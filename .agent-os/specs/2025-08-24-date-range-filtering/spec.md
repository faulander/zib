> Spec: Date Range Filtering for Articles
> Created: 2025-08-24
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement date range filtering functionality to allow users to filter articles by publication date, enabling focused browsing of content from specific time periods.

## User Stories

### Time-Based Content Discovery

As an RSS reader user, I want to filter articles by date ranges, so that I can focus on recent content, catch up on articles from a specific period, or find historical content.

Users will be able to select date ranges using preset options (Today, Last Week, Last Month) or custom date pickers. The filtering will work alongside existing content filters and search functionality. This solves the problem of finding content from specific time periods in large article collections.

## Spec Scope

1. **Preset date range filters** - Quick access to common ranges (today, yesterday, last 7 days, last 30 days)
2. **Custom date range selection** - Calendar picker for specific start and end dates
3. **Integration with existing filters** - Date ranges work alongside content filters, search, and category filtering
4. **Relative date handling** - Smart handling of timezone differences and relative dates
5. **Performance optimization** - Efficient database queries for date range filtering

## Out of Scope

- Time-of-day filtering (focus on date-level granularity)
- Recurring date patterns (weekly, monthly schedules)
- Date range presets beyond common use cases
- Article scheduling or future date handling

## Expected Deliverable

1. Users can filter articles by selecting date ranges through preset buttons or custom date picker
2. Date filtering integrates seamlessly with existing search and content filtering
3. Date range queries perform efficiently even with large article collections
