> Spec: Mobile Responsive Settings Page Fix
> Created: 2025-08-20
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Fix the settings page to be properly responsive on mobile devices by implementing the same sidebar behavior as the main application page, ensuring all settings are accessible and usable on mobile screens.

## User Stories

### Mobile Settings Access

As a mobile user, I want to access and modify all RSS reader settings from my phone, so that I can manage my feeds, filters, and preferences without needing a desktop computer.

**Workflow**: User opens settings on mobile, sees a hamburger menu instead of fixed sidebar, taps to reveal navigation, selects a section, and the sidebar automatically closes to show the content full-screen with all controls properly sized for touch interaction.

### Consistent Mobile Experience

As a user who switches between desktop and mobile, I want the settings page to follow the same navigation patterns as the main article view, so that the interface feels consistent and predictable across the application.

**Workflow**: User familiar with main page navigation immediately understands how to navigate settings on mobile - same hamburger menu location, same swipe gestures, same overlay behavior when sidebar is open.

## Spec Scope

1. **Responsive Sidebar Navigation** - Convert fixed sidebar to mobile-responsive with hamburger menu toggle
2. **Touch-Optimized Controls** - Ensure all buttons, inputs, and interactive elements are properly sized for mobile
3. **Swipe Gesture Support** - Add swipe-to-open and swipe-to-close sidebar gestures matching main page
4. **Form Layout Adaptation** - Adjust multi-column layouts to single column on mobile screens
5. **Modal/Overlay Fixes** - Ensure delete confirmations and other modals work properly on mobile

## Out of Scope

- Changing the desktop settings experience (must remain unchanged)
- Adding new settings or features
- Modifying backend settings API

## Expected Deliverable

1. Settings page sidebar toggles with hamburger menu on mobile devices (<768px)
2. All settings sections are fully accessible and usable on mobile screens
3. Consistent navigation behavior between main page and settings page on all devices
