## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

**FeedPriorityCalculator**
- Test priority score calculation with various feed states
- Test priority factors weighting (unread count, user activity, posting frequency)
- Test edge cases (new feeds, failed feeds, inactive feeds)
- Test priority score normalization and bounds checking

**SmartRefreshService** 
- Test feed queue ordering by priority
- Test batch processing logic and size limits
- Test individual feed refresh error handling
- Test resource monitoring and adaptive batch sizing
- Test refresh pause/resume functionality

**Database Migrations**
- Test migration scripts add required fields correctly
- Test migration rollback scenarios
- Test data integrity during schema changes
- Test index creation and performance impact

### Integration Tests

**Smart Refresh API Endpoints**
- Test `/api/feeds/refresh/smart` endpoint functionality  
- Test refresh status tracking and progress reporting
- Test concurrent refresh request handling (409 errors)
- Test API authentication and authorization
- Test error responses for database failures

**Auto-Refresh Service Integration**
- Test smart refresh integration with existing auto-refresh service
- Test fallback to standard refresh when smart refresh fails
- Test settings-based refresh method selection
- Test frontend synchronization during smart refresh

**Priority Calculation Integration**
- Test priority calculation with real feed data
- Test posting pattern analysis using historical data
- Test user engagement tracking integration
- Test priority score persistence and retrieval

### Feature Tests

**End-to-End Smart Refresh Flow**
- Test complete smart refresh cycle from trigger to completion
- Test user sees high-priority feed updates first
- Test system performance with large feed lists (100+ feeds)
- Test refresh interruption and recovery scenarios

**Performance Testing**
- Test refresh performance improvement vs. standard refresh
- Test memory usage during large feed list processing
- Test database query performance with new indexes
- Test system responsiveness during refresh operations

**Backwards Compatibility Testing**
- Test existing auto-refresh functionality remains intact
- Test frontend mark-as-read-on-scroll continues working during smart refresh
- Test existing API endpoints function normally
- Test migration from standard to smart refresh is seamless

### Mocking Requirements

**External Feed Sources**
- Mock HTTP responses for feed fetching with various scenarios:
  - Successful responses with new articles
  - HTTP errors (404, 500, timeout)
  - Malformed RSS/Atom feeds
  - Slow responses for timeout testing

**Time-Based Operations**
- Mock `pendulum.now()` for consistent test timing
- Mock posting pattern analysis with controlled historical data
- Mock refresh duration measurements for performance testing

**Database Operations**
- Mock database failures for error handling tests
- Mock migration scenarios for schema change testing
- Mock large dataset queries for performance testing

## Test Data Requirements

### Sample Feed Data
- Mix of high-priority feeds (news, tech) and low-priority feeds (personal blogs)
- Feeds with different posting frequencies (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Feeds with various failure states and success rates
- New feeds without historical data

### Historical Data
- 2-week posting history for pattern analysis testing
- User engagement data (article reads, star rates)
- Previous refresh performance metrics
- Feed health tracking data (success/failure rates)
