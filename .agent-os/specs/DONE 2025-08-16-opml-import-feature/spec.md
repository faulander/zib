# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: OPML Import Feature
> Created: 2025-08-16
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement comprehensive OPML import functionality to allow users to seamlessly migrate their feed subscriptions from other RSS readers into Zib. This feature will support hierarchical OPML structure parsing, intelligent duplicate handling, feed validation, and provide detailed import progress tracking.

## User Stories

### RSS Reader Migration

As an RSS reader user migrating to Zib, I want to import my existing OPML file, so that I can quickly set up all my feed subscriptions without manually adding each feed.

Users can upload their OPML export file through the API, and Zib will automatically parse the hierarchical structure, create categories as needed, import all feeds, validate feed URLs, and provide a comprehensive summary of the import results including any feeds that couldn't be imported and why.

### Bulk Feed Management

As a power user managing hundreds of feeds, I want to import multiple OPML files or large OPML structures, so that I can efficiently organize my feed collection without overwhelming the system.

Users can monitor import progress in real-time, receive detailed reports on duplicate handling decisions, and get actionable feedback on any validation errors that require manual intervention.

### Feed Collection Sharing

As an RSS enthusiast, I want to import curated OPML collections shared by others, so that I can discover new feeds organized by topic or expertise.

Users can import OPML files while choosing how to handle duplicates (skip, update, or merge) and organize imported feeds into existing or new category structures.

## Spec Scope

1. **OPML File Upload API** - RESTful endpoint for OPML file upload with multipart/form-data support
2. **OPML Parser Engine** - Parse OPML XML structure and extract categories and feed information
3. **Category Creation System** - Create nested category structure from OPML outline hierarchy
4. **Feed Import Pipeline** - Import feeds with URL validation and metadata extraction
5. **Duplicate Detection & Handling** - Intelligent duplicate feed and category detection with configurable strategies
6. **Progress Tracking System** - Real-time import progress reporting with WebSocket or polling support
7. **Error Reporting Module** - Comprehensive error collection and user-friendly reporting
8. **Import Summary Generation** - Detailed post-import report with statistics and recommendations

## Out of Scope

- OPML export functionality (separate feature)
- Real-time feed synchronization during import
- OPML editing or modification features
- Import scheduling or automation
- Bulk feed deletion or management (separate feature)
- OPML format validation beyond basic XML parsing

## Expected Deliverable

1. Users can successfully upload OPML files through the API and receive immediate import confirmation
2. Categories are automatically created matching the OPML outline structure with proper nesting
3. All valid feeds from OPML are imported with working subscriptions and initial feed fetching
4. Duplicate feeds and categories are handled according to user-specified strategies without data loss
5. Import progress can be monitored through the API with real-time status updates
6. Detailed import summary shows success/failure counts, duplicate handling decisions, and validation errors
7. Failed imports provide actionable error messages helping users resolve feed issues manually
