# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-20-mobile-settings-fix/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-20
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- Import and use existing mobile sidebar stores (`isMobile`, `isSidebarOpen`, `toggleSidebar`) from `$lib/stores/sidebar.js`
- Implement hamburger menu button matching main page design and position
- Add responsive utility classes to hide/show sidebar based on screen size
- Convert fixed width sidebar (`w-80`) to responsive behavior
- Implement overlay backdrop when sidebar is open on mobile
- Add swipe gesture handlers for opening/closing sidebar
- Ensure all form layouts switch from multi-column to single-column on mobile
- Adjust button sizes and spacing for touch targets (minimum 44x44px)
- Fix modal positioning and sizing for mobile viewports

## Approach Options

**Option A: Duplicate Mobile Logic**
- Pros: Independent implementation, no risk to main page
- Cons: Code duplication, maintenance burden, inconsistent behavior

**Option B: Reuse Existing Mobile Sidebar System** (Selected)
- Pros: Consistent behavior, no code duplication, already tested
- Cons: Need to ensure settings-specific content works with shared system

**Rationale:** Option B leverages the already-working mobile sidebar system from the main page, ensuring consistency and reducing code duplication. The existing stores and utilities can be imported and used directly.

## External Dependencies

- **No new dependencies required** - Uses existing Svelte stores and TailwindCSS utilities

## Implementation Architecture

### Mobile Detection and State
- Import `isMobile`, `isSidebarOpen` stores from existing sidebar module
- Use same breakpoint (768px) as main application
- Subscribe to window resize events already handled by sidebar store

### Sidebar Transformation
- Add conditional classes based on `$isMobile` state
- Mobile: absolute/fixed positioning with transform transitions
- Desktop: static positioning with fixed width
- Overlay backdrop element that appears when sidebar open on mobile

### Navigation Updates
- Add hamburger menu button in header (mobile only)
- Auto-close sidebar after section selection on mobile
- Maintain section state across sidebar toggles

### Layout Adjustments
- Grid layouts: `grid-cols-1` on mobile, `md:grid-cols-2` on desktop
- Form controls: full width on mobile with proper spacing
- Buttons: larger touch targets with `p-3` or `p-4` on mobile
- Modals: full screen or near full screen on mobile

### Touch Gestures
- Reuse swipe detection logic from main layout
- Swipe right from left edge opens sidebar
- Swipe left closes sidebar
- Same threshold values as main page (75px)
