# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: OPML Import/Export Performance & UX Improvements
> Created: 2025-08-22
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Enhance the OPML Import/Export functionality to provide a faster, more user-friendly experience with real-time progress tracking, performance optimizations, and working export capabilities.

## User Stories

### Power User with Large OPML Files

As a power RSS user migrating from another service with 200+ feeds, I want to import my OPML file quickly with real-time progress feedback, so that I can see the import status and have confidence the process is working efficiently.

The user can upload their large OPML file and see a progress modal showing which categories are being processed, how many feeds have been imported, overall progress percentage, and the ability to cancel if needed. The import completes in under 2 minutes instead of 5+ minutes.

### RSS Enthusiast Backing Up Feeds

As an RSS enthusiast who wants to backup their feed collection, I want to export my feeds to an OPML file, so that I can migrate to another service or keep a backup of my subscriptions.

The user can click an export button in the settings, choose export options (all feeds, specific categories, etc.), and download a properly formatted OPML file containing all their feed subscriptions and category organization.

### User Monitoring Import Progress

As a user importing feeds, I want to see real-time progress during the import process, so that I know the system is working and can estimate completion time.

The user sees a modal with live updates showing current phase (parsing, validating feeds, creating categories, importing feeds), current item being processed, progress bar, and estimated time remaining.

## Spec Scope

1. **Performance Optimization** - Optimize import process to handle 200 feeds in under 2 minutes
2. **Progress Modal UI** - Real-time progress tracking with cancel functionality  
3. **OPML Export Implementation** - Complete working export functionality with options
4. **Backend API Improvements** - Enhanced progress tracking and performance optimizations
5. **Error Handling Enhancement** - Better error reporting and recovery mechanisms

## Out of Scope

- Import scheduling or automation
- OPML format validation beyond current capabilities
- Bulk feed editing during import process
- Multi-user import job management
- Import history beyond current job tracking

## Expected Deliverable

1. OPML import processes 200 feeds in under 2 minutes with optimized database operations
2. Progress modal displays real-time import status with phase information and progress percentage
3. Users can cancel import operations mid-process with proper cleanup
4. OPML export functionality creates valid OPML files for download
5. Export supports filtering by categories and includes proper hierarchy
6. Enhanced error messages provide actionable feedback for failed imports
7. All existing import functionality remains working with improved performance
