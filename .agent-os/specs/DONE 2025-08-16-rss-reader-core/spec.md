# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: RSS Reader Core Functionality
> Created: 2025-08-16
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement the essential RSS reader functionality that transforms Zib from a feed management system into a functional RSS reader. This includes RSS/Atom feed parsing, article storage, background feed updates, and the article reading API that enables users to actually consume RSS content.

## User Stories

### Feed Content Consumer

As an RSS user, I want to read articles from my subscribed feeds, so that I can stay informed about topics I care about.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. User has previously imported OPML and added RSS feeds
2. System automatically fetches and parses RSS/Atom feeds in the background
3. New articles are stored in the database with full content and metadata
4. User accesses articles through API endpoints with filtering capabilities (by feed, category, read status)
5. User can mark articles as read/unread to track their reading progress
6. System continues to refresh feeds automatically to provide fresh content

### Content Discovery and Filtering

As a power RSS user, I want to filter and search through my articles, so that I can quickly find relevant content among hundreds of articles.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. User queries articles with various filters (feed, category, read status, date range)
2. System returns paginated results with article previews
3. User can search across article titles and content using text search
4. System provides efficient access to both recent articles and archived content

### Background Feed Management

As a self-hosted RSS user, I want feeds to update automatically in the background, so that I always have fresh content without manual intervention.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. System runs background tasks that fetch feeds based on configured intervals
2. New articles are parsed and stored, avoiding duplicates
3. Feed health is monitored and errors are logged
4. System gracefully handles temporary feed failures and network issues

## Spec Scope

1. **Article Database Model** - Complete article storage with title, content, URL, timestamps, and read status
2. **RSS/Atom Feed Parser** - Service to fetch and parse feeds using existing feedparser library
3. **Background Feed Updater** - Scheduled task system for automatic feed refreshing
4. **Article CRUD API** - Endpoints for retrieving, filtering, and managing articles
5. **Read Status Management** - Track and update read/unread status for articles

## Out of Scope

- Advanced filtering rules engine (covered in Phase 3)
- Full-text search indexing (Phase 3 feature)
- Article export functionality (Phase 5)
- Real-time feed updates via WebSockets
- Article content enhancement or cleaning

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Working RSS Reader** - Users can view articles from their subscribed feeds through API endpoints
2. **Automated Feed Updates** - Feeds refresh automatically in the background without user intervention
3. **Read Status Tracking** - Users can mark articles as read/unread and filter by read status
