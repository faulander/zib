> Spec: Reading Time Estimates for Articles
> Created: 2025-08-24
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Calculate and display estimated reading times for RSS articles to help users manage their reading sessions and prioritize content based on available time.

## User Stories

### Time-Based Reading Planning

As a busy RSS reader user, I want to see estimated reading times for articles, so that I can choose what to read based on how much time I have available.

Users will see reading time estimates (e.g., "3 min read") displayed on article cards and in the article modal. The system will calculate estimates based on article word count and average reading speed. This helps users make informed decisions about what to read during short breaks versus longer reading sessions.

## Spec Scope

1. **Reading time calculation** - Calculate estimates based on article word count and configurable reading speed
2. **Article card display** - Show reading time estimates on article cards in the main feed view
3. **Article modal display** - Display reading time in the article modal header
4. **Configurable reading speed** - Allow users to adjust reading speed in settings (150-300 WPM range)
5. **Smart rounding** - Display times in user-friendly format (1 min, 5 min read, etc.)

## Out of Scope

- Reading progress tracking (how much user has read)
- Actual reading time measurement
- Different reading speeds for different content types
- Multi-language reading speed variations

## Expected Deliverable

1. All articles display reading time estimates in a consistent, user-friendly format
2. Reading time calculations are accurate within reasonable margins
3. Users can adjust reading speed preferences to match their reading pace
