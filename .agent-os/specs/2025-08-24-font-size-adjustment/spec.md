> Spec: Font Size Adjustment for Accessibility
> Created: 2025-08-24
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement user-configurable font size adjustment to improve accessibility and reading comfort across different devices and user preferences. This feature will help users with visual impairments and personal reading preferences.

## User Stories

### Accessible Reading Experience

As a user with visual impairments or specific reading preferences, I want to adjust the font size throughout the RSS reader, so that I can comfortably read content at my preferred text size.

Users will be able to increase or decrease font sizes for article content, article lists, and interface elements. The system will remember their preferences and apply them consistently across all views. This solves accessibility issues and accommodates users who prefer different text sizes for optimal reading comfort.

## Spec Scope

1. **Article content font adjustment** - Scale font sizes within article modals and reading view
2. **Article list font adjustment** - Adjust font sizes in the main article feed view
3. **Interface font scaling** - Scale sidebar, headers, and navigation text
4. **Persistent preferences** - Save font size settings to user preferences
5. **Responsive scaling** - Ensure font adjustments work well on mobile and desktop

## Out of Scope

- Complete theme customization beyond font sizes
- Per-component font size controls (single global setting)
- Font family selection (focus on size only)
- Advanced typography controls (line spacing, letter spacing)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Users can adjust font size across the entire interface with a simple control
2. Font size preferences are saved and applied consistently on all page loads
3. Font scaling works well on both mobile and desktop without breaking layout
