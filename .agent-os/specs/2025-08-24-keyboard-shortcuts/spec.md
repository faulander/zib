> Spec: Keyboard Shortcuts for Navigation
> Created: 2025-08-24
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement comprehensive keyboard shortcuts for the RSS reader to enable fast navigation without mouse interaction. This feature will enhance productivity for power users and improve accessibility.

## User Stories

### Power User Navigation

As a power user, I want to navigate the RSS reader entirely with keyboard shortcuts, so that I can efficiently browse feeds and articles without switching between keyboard and mouse.

Users will be able to use standard navigation keys to move between feeds, articles, and interface elements. Common actions like marking as read, starring, and opening articles will have dedicated shortcuts. This solves the productivity bottleneck of constantly switching between keyboard and mouse during reading sessions.

## Spec Scope

1. **Feed navigation shortcuts** - Navigate between categories, feeds, and article lists using arrow keys and tab
2. **Article navigation shortcuts** - Move through article lists, open articles, and control reading state
3. **Action shortcuts** - Mark as read, star articles, refresh feeds, and toggle interface elements
4. **Search and filter shortcuts** - Quick access to search bar and filter controls
5. **Modal and popup shortcuts** - Navigate and control article modals, settings, and other overlays

## Out of Scope

- Customizable keyboard shortcuts (use standard web patterns)
- Vim-style navigation modes
- Complex multi-key combinations

## Expected Deliverable

1. Users can navigate the entire interface using only keyboard
2. All major actions have keyboard shortcuts with visual indicators
3. Keyboard shortcuts work consistently across desktop and mobile (where applicable)
