## 2025-08-16: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Build Zib as an opinionated, self-hosted RSS reader focusing on powerful filtering capabilities and mobile-first design. Target single users who want advanced features without subscription costs. Core MVP includes OPML import/export, split-pane interface, dark/light themes, and robust filtering system.

### Context

The RSS reader market lacks a solution that combines powerful filtering (like Inoreader) with self-hosting and mobile-first design. Existing free readers offer basic functionality, while advanced features are locked behind paywalls. There's an opportunity to create an opinionated reader that provides premium features in a self-hosted package.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Build on existing RSS reader (FreshRSS, Miniflux)**
   - Pros: Faster development, existing user base, proven architecture
   - Cons: Limited by existing design decisions, harder to implement opinionated features, mobile experience often secondary

2. **Create a SaaS solution**
   - Pros: Easier deployment for users, potential revenue stream, centralized updates
   - Cons: Ongoing hosting costs, privacy concerns, competition with established players

3. **Browser extension approach**
   - Pros: No hosting required, integrates with existing browsing
   - Cons: Limited functionality, platform restrictions, poor mobile support

### Rationale

Self-hosted solution provides users complete control over their data while avoiding subscription fatigue. Mobile-first design addresses the reality that most content consumption happens on mobile devices. The opinionated filtering system differentiates from generic RSS readers by solving the information overload problem.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Users own their data and reading habits
- No recurring costs after initial setup
- Advanced features available to all users
- Can iterate quickly based on user needs

**Negative:**
- Users need technical knowledge for deployment
- No centralized updates (must pull Docker updates)
- Single-user focus limits collaboration features
- Self-hosting requires maintenance

## 2025-08-16: Technology Stack Selection

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Use Python FastAPI for backend with Peewee ORM and SQLite database. Frontend built with SvelteKit and TailwindCSS. Deploy via Docker for easy self-hosting.

### Context

Need a technology stack that balances performance, developer productivity, and ease of deployment for self-hosted applications. The stack should handle RSS parsing efficiently while providing a responsive user interface.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Django + HTMX**
   - Pros: Batteries included, minimal JavaScript, proven for RSS readers
   - Cons: Heavier framework, less modern UI capabilities, harder to create mobile-first experience

2. **Node.js Full Stack (Next.js)**
   - Pros: Single language, excellent mobile performance, large ecosystem
   - Cons: RSS parsing less mature in JavaScript, higher memory usage

3. **Go + Vue.js**
   - Pros: Excellent performance, low resource usage, good for self-hosting
   - Cons: Longer development time, smaller ecosystem for RSS tools

### Rationale

FastAPI provides excellent performance with Python's rich ecosystem for RSS parsing and text processing. Peewee with SQLite offers simplicity perfect for single-user applications. SvelteKit enables building a truly mobile-first, reactive interface. Docker simplifies deployment for non-technical users.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Fast development with Python's RSS libraries
- Type safety with Pydantic and TypeScript
- Excellent mobile performance with SvelteKit
- Simple deployment via Docker
- Low resource usage with SQLite

**Negative:**
- Two languages to maintain (Python + JavaScript)
- SQLite limits multi-user scenarios
- Requires building custom UI components
- Docker adds deployment complexity for some users
